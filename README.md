# We Should Hang Out


## Description Deliverable


### Elevator Pitch
We Should Hang Out will be an exclusive online platform crafted for college students, recognizing that even in a social environment, making friends can be challenging, especially for those who are shy or spend a lot of time focused on their studies. This platform will be designed to bridge that gap, connecting like-minded peers with shared interests. Whether you enjoy exploring new places, playing boardgames, staying active, or engaging in meaningful conversations.

### HTML Deliverable
For this deliverable I built out the structure of my application using HTML.

- **HTML pages** - Two HTML page that represent the ability to login and vote.
- **Links** - The login page automatically links to the voter page. The voter page contains links for every voting choice.
- **Text** - Each of the voting choices is represented by a textual description.
- **Images** - I couldn't figure out how to include an image and so I didn't do this. ðŸ˜”
- **DB/Login** - Input box and submit button for login. The voting choices represent data pulled from the database.
- **WebSocket** - The count of voting results represent the tally of realtime votes.
