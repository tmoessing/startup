# We Should Hang Out


## Description Deliverable


### Elevator Pitch
We Should Hang Out will be an exclusive online platform crafted for college students, recognizing that even in a social environment, making friends can be challenging, especially for those who are shy or spend a lot of time focused on their studies. This platform will be designed to bridge that gap, connecting like-minded peers with shared interests. Whether you enjoy exploring new places, playing boardgames, staying active, or engaging in meaningful conversations.

### HTML Deliverable
For this deliverable I built out the structure of my application using HTML.

- **HTML pages** - A Variety of HTML pages with capabilites to view all events, one to plan an event, one to register, log in and log out. 
- **Links** - The navigation bar at the top allows the user to navigate to all the HTML pages.
- **Text** - Starting off at the welcome page there is text to introuduce the user to the website.
- **Images** - On each HTML page there is a logo on the top of each page.
- **DB/Login** - Input box and submit button for login. The plan event will push to the data base. The Hangout Hub will pull from the database.
- **WebSocket** - In the Hangout Hub, it will pull all the events created from other users.
